Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2. Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4] Output: 2.50000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Constraints:

nums1.length == m nums2.length == n 0 <= m <= 1000 0 <= n <= 1000 1 <= m + n <= 2000 -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106
